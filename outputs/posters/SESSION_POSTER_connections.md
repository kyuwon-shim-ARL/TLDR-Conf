## 💡 활용 팁

### 1. 세션 직후 바로 확인
```
S1 들음 (15:30 종료)
  ↓
이 가이드에서 관심 발표의 포스터 확인 (5분)
  ↓
16:30 포스터 세션 시작
  ↓
추천 포스터부터 방문!
```

### 2. 질문 준비
세션에서 이해 안 된 부분을 포스터 발표자에게 질문:
- "아까 Tao Dong 교수님 발표에서 phase separation 나왔는데, 이 연구도 관련있나요?"
- 발표자: "오! 그 발표 들으셨군요. 사실 저희 T6SS 연구도..."

→ **깊이 있는 대화 가능!**

### 3. 네트워킹 강화
"저도 그 분야 관심 있어서 방금 발표 들었어요"
→ 공통 관심사로 쉽게 연결
